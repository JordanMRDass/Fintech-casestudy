## Origination
Unhedged was formed in late 2020 by Peter Bakker, with his two co-founders: Glenn Vanbavinckhove and Saskia Albers, both with quantitative analyst experience in Deloitte and Volt Bank. Glenn additionally leads the company in its Cloud computing and AI. The foundation of Unhedged is to bring advanced investment tools to the "everyday investor".

## Initial funding and a massive breakthrough
Bakker started up Unhedged with a pre-seed of $550k, receiving further seed funding by venture capitalist Littleblanc Advisor LLC. and Palm Ventures. Finally receiving, what would be a majority of their funds and indication of rapid interest in their operations, with crowd equity-funding far exceeding their minimum target of $350,000 by $2 million.

## Purpose
'Unhedged' is at the forefront of algorithmized wealth management. The combination of tried and true investment practices of hedge fund experts and the artificial intelligence of machinery form a dynamic duo, disrupting the balance of the typical exclusive high cost of entry funds. Usage of low-cost bots instead of high-flying hedge fund managers brings down the costs passed onto investors. "Everyday investors" receive top-of-the-line strategies with lower commissions while algorithmically powered bots run 24/7, to exceed subpar returns these investors make by themselves.
