## **Origination**
Unhedged was formed in late 2020 by Peter Bakker, with his two co-founders: Glenn Vanbavinckhove and Saskia Albers, both with quantitative analyst experience in Deloitte and Volt Bank. Glenn additionally leads the company in its Cloud computing and AI. The foundation of Unhedged is to bring advanced investment tools to the "everyday investor".

<br /> 
<br /> 

## **Initial funding and a massive breakthrough**
Bakker started up Unhedged with a pre-seed of $550k, receiving further seed funding by venture capitalist Littleblanc Advisor LLC. and Palm Ventures. Finally receiving, what would be a majority of their funds and indication of rapid interest in their operations, with crowd equity-funding far exceeding their minimum target of $350,000 by $2 million. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
## Purpose
'Unhedged' is at the forefront of algorithmized wealth management. The combination of tried and true investment practices of hedge and mutual fund experts and the artificial intelligence of machinery form a dynamic duo, disrupting the balance of the typical exclusive high cost of entry funds. Unhedged strives to give each equal opportunity at wealth.

# Business Activities

## The Wealth Management industry
Off the back of the housing market crash in 2008, old guards of fund management in Europe fell off their performances pre-2008 with new markets rising in Asia.
<br /> 
This coincided with the shift away from traditional elitist advisor relationship, to more transparent and automated advisors.
<br /> 
Estimated, in 2019, to hold $89 trillion dollars in global assets, the wealth management industry is massive and continually growing.

## Customer Base
These "everyday investors" that 'Unhedged' describes are less liquid with lower incomes than their hedge and mutual fund counterparts. Seen by Unhedged's offering of fees 0.49% per annum and performance fees of 20%, compared to the standard 2% fees/20% performance fees.
 <br /> 
 The low entry investments required provide additional evidence of catering to lower-income customers with less liquidity. 
 <br /> 
<br /> 
 | Unhedged | Typical Hedge | Mutual funds|
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| 0.49% base fee | 2% base fee |0.29% - 1.5% base fees|
| 20% performance fee | 20% performance fee |20% performance fee	|
|$10,000 base investment|$100,000 to $1,000,000 base investment| $500 to $5000 base investment|
|No fees for normal profits|8% fee for profits made|No fees for normal profits|

With 7000+ already on the wait list awaiting the release and the large amount of retail and institutional investors

<br /> 

- ## *Current*
    With 7000+ people on the waitlist pre-release. Their current customer base is relatively small compared to their competition due to the possible wariness of algorithmic trading compared to human knowledge. However, with institutional and retail investors building to 638 unique investors in equity crowdfunding, Unhedged can be excited for a budding belief in their product, in the form of $1.7 million on their laps.
- ## *Potential*
    The potential of Unhedged is exciting as it could potentially exceed the usual customer base of hedge and mutual funds. Unhedged caters not only to high-income individuals but to the middle class without pre-requisite financial savviness. As artificial intelligence becomes more mainstream, budding interest in their product could potentially explode as a staple financial product for the middle class.

## Unhedged's unfair bottom line
- Usage of no-cost bots with financial theories instead of high-flying hedge fund managers brings down the costs passed onto investors as base fees and normal fees. "Everyday investors" receive top-of-the-line strategies with lower commissions while algorithmically powered bots run 24/7, to exceed subpar returns these retail investors are able to make by themselves. Offering hedge fund performance at low mutual fund rates.
- A 24/7 operating time, affords maximisation of possible opportunities during the entire day with high frequency trading.
- Offering an insight into algorithms used, Unhedged offers a great amount of transparency into trades and why they were performed.
<br /> 
<br /> 

## Technology behind the machines
1. ### Micro-economic Algorithms
    Momentum indicators: Select stocks based on strength of momentum (number of up days), but also the velocity of that momentum using the **Average True Range**. This indicators shows the volatility of price stock over a period.
2. ### Macro-economic Algorithms
     - Uptrend: Rotating between ETFs allocating to different sectors in the S&P500
     - Downtrend: Buy safe securities in short and long term duration bonds
     <br /> 
    *Weighting based on machine learning algorithms to ensure sectors contribute equal risk to the portfolio

## Success in the Wealth Management industry
Success is measured by the consistent outperformance of major ETF indexes (benchmarks for performance), for example, percentage points higher than the SPY tracking the S&P500.
<br /> 
According to Unhedged, their algorithm has outperformed the index based on backtest, repeating past stock movements.

<br /> In the attached picture above, we see a simple momentum strategy (using the crossing of exponential moving averages, as bullish and bearish signs) significantly outperforming the market, shown by an alpha that is greater than 0, while being less sensitive to market movements, seen by beta lower than 1.
<br /> Unhedged with a more complex momentum strategy taking into account the velocity of the momentum, unhedged should expect to be equal to or outperform the simple strategy.
<br /> 
<br /> 

## Recommendations

### Variety of Algorithms
With the wide variety of consumers and their respective risk appetites, Unhedged could look into different algorithms for these sets of people. An algorithm with low risk by selecting diversified portfolios would be appealing to the "everyday investor". Many households look to build up capital, rather than chase profits in the present. This requires the use of a different set of algorithms powering machine learning to allocate stocks accordingly.

### Robo-advisor

<br /> Unhedged could also look to implement robo-advisors to help clear up certain questions customers may have concerning algorithms used or the fees system. Machine learning and AI could also be utilized in robo-advisors to screen stocks for customers to potentially add to momentum portfolios. This satisfies customers' need for control over their money making their own selections.
